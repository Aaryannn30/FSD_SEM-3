<p class="noindent">
FELLOW STUDENTS—
</p>

<p>
Every man has a philosophy
of life in thought, in
word, or in deed, worked out
in himself unconsciously.  In
possession of the very best, he
may not know of its existence;
with the very worst he may
pride himself as a paragon.  As
it grows with the growth it
cannot be taught to the young
in formal lectures.  What have
bright eyes, red blood, quick
breath and taut muscles to do
with philosophy?  Did not the
great Stagirite say that young
men were unfit students of it?—they
will hear as though they
heard not, and to no profit.
Why then should I trouble you?
Because I have a message that
may be helpful.  It is not
philosophical, nor is it strictly moral
or religious, one or other of
which I was told my address
should be, and yet in a way it
is all three.  It is the oldest and
the freshest, the simplest and
the most useful, so simple
indeed is it that some of you may
turn away disappointed as was
Naaman the Syrian when told to
go wash in Jordan and be clean.
You know those composite tools,
to be bought for 50 cents, with
one handle to fit a score or more
of instruments.  The workmanship
is usually bad, so bad, as
a rule, that you will not find
an example in any good
carpenter's shop; but the boy has
one, the chauffeur slips one into
his box, and the sailor into his
kit, and there is one in the
odds-and-ends drawer of the pantry
of every well-regulated family.
It is simply a handy thing about
the house, to help over the many
little difficulties of the day.  Of
this sort of philosophy I wish
to make you a present—a handle
to fit your life tools.  Whether
the workmanship is Sheffield or
shoddy, this helve will fit anything
from a hatchet to a corkscrew.
</p>

<p>
My message is but a word,
<i>a Way</i>, an easy expression of
the experience of a plain man
whose life has never been
worried by any philosophy higher
than that of the shepherd in
<i>As You Like It</i>.  I wish to point
out a path in which the wayfaring
man, though a fool, cannot
err; not a system to be worked
out painfully only to be
discarded, not a formal scheme,
simply a habit as easy—or as
hard!—to adopt as any other
habit, good or bad.
</p>

<h3>
I
</h3>

<p>
A few years ago a Xmas
card went the rounds, with the
legend "Life is just one 'denied'
thing after another," which, in
more refined language, is the
same as saying "Life is a
habit," a succession of actions
that become more or less
automatic.  This great truth, which
lies at the basis of all actions,
muscular or psychic, is the
keystone of the teaching of
Aristotle, to whom the formation
of habits was the basis of moral
excellence.  "In a word, habits
of any kind are the result
of actions of the same kind;
and so what we have to do,
is to give a certain character
to these particular actions"
(<i>Ethics</i>).  Lift a seven months
old baby to his feet—see him
tumble on his nose.  Do the
same at twelve months—he
walks.  At two years he runs.
The muscles and the nervous
system have acquired the habit.
One trial after another, one
failure after another, has given
him power.  Put your finger
in a baby's mouth, and he
sucks away in blissful
anticipation of a response to a
mammalian habit millions of years
old.  And we can deliberately
train parts of our body to
perform complicated actions with
unerring accuracy.  Watch that
musician playing a difficult
piece.  Batteries, commutators,
multipliers, switches, wires
innumerable control those nimble
fingers, the machinery of which
may be set in motion as
automatically as in a pianola, the
player all the time chatting as
if he had nothing to do in
controlling the apparatus—habit
again, the gradual acquisition
of power by long practice and
at the expense of many
mistakes.  The same great law
reaches through mental and
moral states.  "Character," which
partakes of both, in Plutarch's
words, is "long-standing habit."
</p>

<p>
Now the way of life that I
preach is a habit to be acquired
gradually by long and steady
repetition.  It is the practice
of living for the day only,
and for the day's work, <i>Life
in day-tight compartments</i>.  "Ah,"
I hear you say, "that is an
easy matter, simple as Elisha's
advice!"  Not as I shall urge
it, in words which fail to
express the depth of my feelings
as to its value.  I started life
in the best of all environments—in
a parsonage, one of nine
children.  A man who has filled
Chairs in four universities, has
written a successful book, and
has been asked to lecture at
Yale, is supposed popularly to
have brains of a special quality.
A few of my intimate friends
really know the truth about
me, as I know it!  Mine, in
good faith I say it, are of the
most mediocre character.  But
what about those professorships,
etc.?  Just habit, a way
of life, an outcome of the day's
work, the vital importance of
which I wish to impress upon
you with all the force at my
command.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Johnson remarked upon
the trifling circumstances by
which men's lives are influenced,
"not by an ascendant planet, a
predominating humour, but by
the first book which they read,
some early conversation which
they have heard, or some
accident which excited ardour and
enthusiasm."  This was my
case in two particulars.  I was
diverted to the Trinity College
School, then at Weston,
Ontario, by a paragraph in the
circular stating that the senior
boys would go into the drawing-room
in the evenings, and learn
to sing and dance—vocal and
pedal accomplishments for which
I was never designed; but like
Saul seeking his asses, I found
something more valuable, a
man of the White of Selborne
type, who knew nature, and
who knew how to get boys
interested in it.[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1" class="pginternal">1</a>]  The other
happened in the summer of
1871, when I was attending the
Montreal General Hospital.
Much worried as to the future,
partly about the final examination,
partly as to what I should
do afterwards, I picked up a
volume of Carlyle, and on the
page I opened there was the
familiar sentence—"<i>Our main
business is not to see what lies
dimly at a distance, but to do
what lies clearly at hand.</i>"  A
commonplace sentiment enough,
but it hit and stuck and helped,
and was the starting-point of a
habit that has enabled me to
utilize to the full the single
talent entrusted to me.

<h3>

<p>
The workers in Christ's
vineyard were hired by the day;
only for this day are we to ask
for our daily bread, and we are
expressly bidden to take no
thought for the morrow.  To the
modern world these commands
have an Oriental savour, counsels
of perfection akin to certain
of the Beatitudes, stimuli to
aspiration, not to action.  I am
prepared on the contrary to
urge the literal acceptance of
the advice, not in the mood of
Ecclesiastes—"Go to now, ye
that say to-day or to-morrow
we will go into such a city, and
continue there a year, and buy
and sell and get gain; whereas
ye know not what shall be on
the morrow"; not in the
Epicurean spirit of Omar with
his "jug of wine and Thou,"
but in the modernist spirit, as
a way of life, a habit, a strong
enchantment, at once against
the mysticism of the East and
the pessimism that too easily
besets us.  Change that hard
saying "Sufficient unto the day
is the evil thereof" into "the
goodness thereof," since the
chief worries of life arise from
the foolish habit of looking
before and after.  As a patient
with double vision from some
transient unequal action of the
muscles of the eye finds magical
relief from well-adjusted glasses,
so, returning to the clear
binocular vision of to-day, the
over-anxious student finds peace
when he looks neither backward
to the past nor forward
to the future.
</p>

<p>
I stood on the bridge of one of
the great liners, ploughing the
ocean at 25 knots.  "She is
alive," said my companion, "in
every plate; a huge monster
with brain and nerves, an
immense stomach, a wonderful
heart and lungs, and a splendid
system of locomotion."  Just at
that moment a signal sounded,
and all over the ship the
water-tight compartments were closed.
"Our chief factor of safety,"
said the Captain.  "In spite of
the <i>Titanic</i>," I said.  "Yes," he
replied, "in spite of the <i>Titanic</i>."  Now
each one of you is a much
more marvellous organization
than the great liner, and bound
on a longer voyage.  What I
urge is that you so learn to
control the machinery as to live
with "day-tight compartments"
as the most certain way to
ensure safety on the voyage.
Get on the bridge, and see that
at least the great bulkheads are
in working order.  Touch a
button and hear, at every level of
your life, the iron doors shutting
out the Past—the dead yesterdays.
Touch another and shut off,
with a metal curtain, the Future—the
unborn to-morrows.  Then you
are safe,—safe for to-day!  Read
the old story in the <i>Chambered
Nautilus</i>, so beautifully sung by
Oliver Wendell Holmes, only
change one line to "Day after
day beheld the silent toil."  Shut
off the past!  Let the dead past
bury its dead.  So easy to say,
so hard to realize!  The truth
is, the past haunts us like a
shadow.  To disregard it is not
easy.  Those blue eyes of your
grandmother, that weak chin of
your grandfather, have mental
and moral counterparts in your
make-up.  Generations of
ancestors, brooding over
"Providence, Foreknowledge, Will
and Fate—Fixed fate, free will,
foreknowledge, absolute," may
have bred a New England
conscience, morbidly sensitive,
to heal which some of you had
rather sing the 51st Psalm than
follow Christ into the slums.
Shut out the yesterdays, which
have lighted fools the way to
dusty death, and have no concern
for you personally, that is,
consciously.  They are there all
right, working daily in us, but so
are our livers and our stomachs.
And the past, in its unconscious
action on our lives, should bother
us as little as they do.  The
petty annoyances, the real and
fancied slights, the trivial
mistakes, the disappointments,
the sins, the sorrows, even the
joys—bury them deep in the
oblivion of each night.  Ah! but
it is just then that to so many of
us the ghosts of the past,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Night-riding Incubi<br>
  Troubling the fantasy,<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
come in troops, and pry open the
eyelids, each one presenting a sin,
a sorrow, a regret.  Bad enough
in the old and seasoned, in the
young these demons of past sins
may be a terrible affliction, and
in bitterness of heart many a
one cries with Eugene Aram,
"Oh God!  Could I so close my
mind, and clasp it with a clasp."  As
a vaccine against all morbid
poisons left in the system by the
infections of yesterday, I offer
"a way of life."  "Undress," as
George Herbert says, "your
soul at night," not by
self-examination, but by shedding, as
you do your garments, the daily
sins whether of omission or of
commission, and you will wake
a free man, with a new life.  To
look back, except on rare
occasions for stock-taking, is to
risk the fate of Lot's wife.
Many a man is handicapped in
his course by a cursed combination
of retro- and intro-spection,
the mistakes of yesterday
paralysing the efforts of to-day, the
worries of the past hugged to
his destruction, and the worm
Regret allowed to canker the
very heart of his life.  To die
daily, after the manner of
St. Paul, ensures the resurrection
of a new man, who makes each
day the epitome of a life.

<p>
The load of to-morrow, added
to that of yesterday, carried
to-day makes the strongest
falter.  Shut off the future as
tightly as the past.  No dreams,
no visions, no delicious fantasies,
no castles in the air, with which,
as the old song so truly says,
"hearts are broken, heads are
turned."  To youth, we are told,
belongs the future, but the
wretched to-morrow that so
plagues some of us has no
certainty, except through
to-day.  Who can tell what a day
may bring forth?  Though its
uncertainty is a proverb, a man
may carry its secret in the hollow
of his hand.  Make a pilgrimage
to Hades with Ulysses, draw the
magic circle, perform the rites,
and then ask Tiresias the
question.  I have had the answer
from his own lips.  The future
is to-day,—there is no to-morrow!
The day of a man's salvation is
<i>now</i>—the life of the present, of
to-day, lived earnestly, intently,
without a forward-looking
thought, is the only insurance
for the future.  Let the limit of
your horizon be a twenty-four
hour circle.  On the title page
of one of the great books of
science, the <i>Discours de la Méthode</i>
of Descartes (1637) is a vignette
showing a man digging in a
garden with his face towards the
earth, on which rays of light are
streaming from the heavens;
beneath is the legend "<i>Fac et
Spera</i>."  'Tis a good attitude and
a good motto.  Look heavenward,
if you wish, but never to
the horizon—that way danger
lies.  Truth is not there, happiness
is not there, certainty is not
there, but the falsehoods, the
frauds, the quackeries, the <i>ignes
fatui</i> which have deceived each
generation—all beckon from the
horizon, and lure the men not
content to look for the truth
and happiness that tumble out
at their feet.  Once while at
College climb a mountain-top,
and get a general outlook of the
land, and make it the occasion
perhaps of that careful examination
of yourself, that inquisition
which Descartes urges every
man to hold once in a lifetime,—not
oftener.
</p>

<p>
Waste of energy, mental
distress, nervous worries dog the
steps of a man who is anxious
about the future.  Shut close,
then, the great fore and aft
bulkheads, and prepare to cultivate
the habit of a life of Day-Tight
Compartments.  Do not be
discouraged,—like every other
habit, the acquisition takes time,
and the way is one you must
find for yourselves.  I can only
give general directions and
encouragement, in the hope
that while the green years are
on your heads, you may have
the courage to persist.
</p>

</h3>

<p>
Now, for the day itself!  What
first?  Be your own daysman! and
sigh not with Job for any
mysterious intermediary, but
prepare to lay your own firm
hand upon the helm.  Get into
touch with the finite, and grasp
in full enjoyment that sense of
capacity in a machine working
smoothly.  Join the whole
creation of animate things in a deep,
heartfelt joy that you are alive,
that you see the sun, that you
are in this glorious earth which
nature has made so beautiful,
and which is yours to conquer
and to enjoy.  Realise, in the
words of Browning, that
"There's a world of capability
for joy spread round about us,
meant for us, inviting us."  What
are the morning
sensations?—for they control the day.
Some of us are congenitally
unhappy during the early hours;
but the young man who feels on
awakening that life is a burden
or a bore has been neglecting
his machine, driving it too hard,
stoking the engines too much,
or not cleaning out the ashes
and clinkers.  Or he has been
too much with the Lady
Nicotine, or fooling with
Bacchus, or, worst of all, with the
younger Aphrodite—all "messengers
of strong prevailment in
unhardened youth."  To have a
sweet outlook on life you must
have a clean body.  As I look on
the clear-cut, alert, earnest
features, and the lithe, active
forms of our college men, I
sometimes wonder whether or
not Socrates and Plato would
find the race improved.  I am
sure they would love to look on
such a gathering as this.  Make
their ideal yours—the fair mind
in the fair body.  The one cannot
be sweet and clean without
the other, and you must realise,
with Rabbi Ben Ezra, the great
truth that flesh and soul are
mutually helpful.  The morning
outlook—which really makes the
day—is largely a question of a
clean machine—of physical
morality in the wide sense of
the term.  "<i>C'est l'estomac qui fait
les heureux,</i>" as Voltaire says;
no dyspeptic can have a sane
outlook on life; and a man
whose bodily functions are
impaired has a lowered moral
resistance.  To keep the body fit is
a help in keeping the mind pure,
and the sensations of the first
few hours of the day are the
best test of its normal state.
The clean tongue, the clear
head, and the bright eye are
birth-rights of each day.  Just
as the late Professor Marsh
would diagnose an unknown
animal from a single bone, so
can the day be predicted from the
first waking hour.  The start
is everything, as you well know,
and to make a good start you
must feel fit.  In the young,
sensations of morning slackness
come most often from lack of
control of the two primal
instincts—biologic habits—the one
concerned with the preservation
of the individual, the other with
the continuance of the species.
Yale students should by this
time be models of dietetic
propriety, but youth does not
always reck the rede of the
teacher; and I dare say that
here, as elsewhere, careless
habits of eating are responsible
for much mental disability.  My
own rule of life has been to cut
out unsparingly any article of
diet that had the bad taste to
disagree with me, or to indicate
in any way that it had abused
the temporary hospitality of the
lodging which I had provided.
To drink, nowadays, but few
students become addicted, but in
every large body of men a few are
to be found whose incapacity for
the day results from the morning
clogging of nocturnally-flushed
tissues.  As moderation is very
hard to reach, and as it has been
abundantly shown that the best
of mental and physical work
may be done without alcohol in
any form, the safest rule for the
young man is that which I am
sure most of you follow—abstinence.
A bitter enemy to the
bright eye and the clear brain of
the early morning is tobacco
when smoked to excess, as it is
now by a large majority of
students.  Watch it, test it, and
if need be, control it.  That
befogged, woolly sensation
reaching from the forehead to the
occiput, that haziness of
memory, that cold fish-like eye,
that furred tongue, and last
week's taste in the mouth—too
many of you know them—I
know them—they often come
from too much tobacco.  The
other primal instinct is the
heavy burden of the flesh which
Nature puts on all of us to
ensure a continuation of the
species.  To drive Plato's team
taxes the energies of the best of
us.  One of the horses is a
raging, untamed devil, who can
only be brought into subjection
by hard fighting and severe
training.  This much you all
know as men: once the bit is
between his teeth the black
steed Passion will take the
white horse Reason with you
and the chariot rattling over the
rocks to perdition.
</p>

<p>
With a fresh, sweet body you
can start aright without those
feelings of inertia that so often,
as Goethe says, make the
morning's lazy leisure usher in
a useless day.  Control of the
mind as a working machine, the
adaptation in it of habit, so that
its action becomes almost as
automatic as walking, is the
end of education—and yet how
rarely reached!  It can be
accomplished with deliberation and
repose, never with hurry and worry.
Realise how much time there is,
how long the day is.  Realise that
you have sixteen waking hours,
three or four of which at least
should be devoted to making a
silent conquest of your mental
machinery.  Concentration, by
which is grown gradually the
power to wrestle successfully
with any subject, is the secret of
successful study.  No mind
however dull can escape the
brightness that comes from
steady application.  There is an
old saying, "Youth enjoyeth not,
for haste"; but worse than this,
the failure to cultivate the power
of peaceful concentration is the
greatest single cause of mental
breakdown.  Plato pities the
young man who started at such
a pace that he never reached the
goal.  One of the saddest of
life's tragedies is the wreckage
of the career of the young
collegian by hurry, hustle,
bustle and tension—the human
machine driven day and night,
as no sensible fellow would use
his motor.  Listen to the words
of a master in Israel, William
James: "Neither the nature
nor the amount of our work is
accountable for the frequency
and severity of our breakdowns,
but their cause lies rather in
those absurd feelings of hurry
and having no time, in that
breathlessness and tension, that
anxiety of feature and that
solicitude of results, that lack
of inner harmony and ease, in
short, by which the work with
us is apt to be accompanied, and
from which a European who
would do the same work would,
nine out of ten times, be free."  <i>Es
bildet ein Talent sich in der Stille</i>,
but it need not be for all day.  A
few hours out of the sixteen
will suffice, only let them be
hours of daily dedication—in
routine, in order and in system,
and day by day you will gain in
power over the mental mechanism,
just as the child does over
the spinal marrow in walking, or
the musician over the nerve
centres.  Aristotle somewhere
says that the student who wins
out in the fight must be slow in
his movements, with voice deep,
and slow speech, and he will not
be worried over trifles which
make people speak in shrill
tones and use rapid movements.
Shut close in hour-tight
compartments, with the mind directed
intensely upon the subject in
hand, you will acquire the
capacity to do more and more,
you will get into training; and
once the mental habit is
established, you are safe for life.
</p>

<p>
Concentration is an art of
slow acquisition, but little by
little the mind is accustomed to
habits of slow eating and
careful digestion, by which alone
you escape the "mental dyspepsy"
so graphically described
by Lowell in the <i>Fable for Critics</i>.
Do not worry your brains about
that bugbear Efficiency, which,
sought consciously and with
effort, is just one of those
elusive qualities very apt to
be missed.  The man's college
output is never to be gauged
at sight; all the world's coarse
thumb and finger may fail to
plumb his most effective work,
the casting of the mental
machinery of self-education,
the true preparation for a field
larger than the college campus.
Four or five hours daily—it is
not much to ask; but one day
must tell another, one week
certify another, one month bear
witness to another of the same
story, and you will acquire a
habit by which the one-talent
man will earn a high interest,
and by which the ten-talent
man may at least save his
capital.
</p>

<p>
Steady work of this sort
gives a man a sane outlook
on the world.  No corrective
so valuable to the weariness,
the fever and the fret that are
so apt to wring the heart of
the young.  This is the talisman,
as George Herbert says,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The famous stone<br>
  That turneth all to gold,<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and with which, to the eternally
recurring question, What is Life?
you answer, I do not think—I
act it; the only philosophy that
brings you in contact with its
real values and enables you to
grasp its hidden meaning.  Over
the Slough of Despond, past
Doubting Castle and Giant
Despair, with this talisman you
may reach the Delectable
Mountains, and those Shepherds
of the Mind—Knowledge,
Experience, Watchful and
Sincere.  Some of you may
think this to be a miserable
Epicurean doctrine—no better
than that so sweetly sung by
Horace:—
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Happy the man—and Happy he alone,<br>
  He who can call to-day his own,<br>
  He who secure within can say,<br>
  To-morrow, do thy worst—for I have lived to-day.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I do not care what you think,
I am simply giving you a philosophy
of life that I have found
helpful in my work, useful in my
play.  Walt Whitman, whose
physician I was for some years,
never spoke to me much of his
poems, though occasionally he
would make a quotation; but I
remember late one summer
afternoon as we sat in the
window of his little house in
Camden there passed a group
of workmen whom he greeted in
his usual friendly way.  And
then he said: "Ah, the glory of
the day's work, whether with
hand or brain!  I have tried
</p>

<p class="poem">
  To exalt the present and the real,<br>
  To teach the average man the glory of<br>
          his daily work or trade."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In this way of life each one
of you may learn to drive the
straight furrow and so come to
the true measure of a man.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
V
</h3>

<p>
With body and mind in training,
what remains?
</p>

<p>
Do you remember that most
touching of all incidents in
Christ's ministry, when the
anxious ruler Nicodemus came
by night, worried lest the things
that pertained to his everlasting
peace were not a part of his
busy and successful life?  Christ's
message to him is His message
to the world—never more needed
than at present: "Ye must be
born of the spirit."  You wish to
be with the leaders—as Yale men
it is your birthright—know the
great souls that make up the
moral radium of the world.  You
must be born of their spirit,
initiated into their fraternity,
whether of the spiritually-minded
followers of the Nazarene or
of that larger company, elect
from every nation, seen by St. John.
</p>

<p>
Begin the day with Christ and
His prayer—you need no other.
Creedless, with it you have
religion; creed-stuffed, it will
leaven any theological dough in
which you stick.  As the soul is
dyed by the thoughts, let no day
pass without contact with the
best literature of the world.
Learn to know your Bible,
though not perhaps as your
fathers did.  In forming character
and in shaping conduct, its
touch has still its ancient power.
Of the kindred of Ram and sons
of Elihu, you should know its
beauties and its strength.
Fifteen or twenty minutes day by
day will give you fellowship with
the great minds of the race, and
little by little as the years pass
you extend your friendship with
the immortal dead.  They will
give you faith in your own day.
Listen while they speak to you
of the fathers.  But each age has
its own spirit and ideas, just as it
has its own manners and pleasures.
You are right to believe
that yours is the best University,
at its best period.  Why should
you look back to be shocked at
the frowsiness and dullness of
the students of the seventies or
even of the nineties?  And cast
no thought forward, lest you
reach a period when you and
yours will present to your
successors the same dowdiness of
clothes and times.  But while
change is the law, certain great
ideas flow fresh through the
ages, and control us effectually
as in the days of Pericles.
Mankind, it has been said, is always
advancing, man is always the
same.  The love, hope, fear and
faith that make humanity, and
the elemental passions of the
human heart, remain unchanged,
and the secret of inspiration in
any literature is the capacity to
touch the cord that vibrates in a
sympathy that knows nor time
nor place.
</p>

<p>
The quiet life in day-tight
compartments will help you to bear
your own and others' burdens
with a light heart.  Pay no heed
to the Batrachians who sit croaking
idly by the stream.  Life is
a straight, plain business, and
the way is clear, blazed for you
by generations of strong men,
into whose labours you enter
and whose ideals must be your
inspiration.  In my mind's eye
I can see you twenty years
hence—resolute-eyed, broad-headed,
smooth-faced men who are in the
world to make a success of life;
but to whichever of the two great
types you belong, whether
controlled by emotion or by reason,
you will need the leaven of their
spirit, the only leaven potent
enough to avert that only too
common Nemesis to which the
Psalmist refers: "He gave them
their heart's desire, but sent
leanness withal into their souls."
</p>

<p>
I quoted Dr. Johnson's remark
about the trivial things that
influence.  Perhaps this slight
word of mine may help some of
you so to number your days that
you may apply your hearts unto
wisdom.

</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
